# django-ranged-fileresponse

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wearespindle/django-ranged-fileresponse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wearespindle/django-ranged-fileresponse)

If you're in the situation that you have an authenticated Django view that returns
files for download, you may have noticed that Safari 9.x doesn't play audio files
properly when returning audio-files. The reason is that Safari sends a HTTP_RANGE request header and expects a proper `Content-Range` response header in return.
There is a [Django ticket](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22479)
for this, however no indication that this feature will be implemented soon.

The [original suggested fix](https://github.com/satchamo/django/commit/2ce75c5c4bee2a858c0214d136bfcd351fcde11d)
applies the code to Django's static view. This is a packaged version of that fix,
but uses a modified FileResponse, instead of applying it to Django's static view.
